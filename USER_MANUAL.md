INTRODUCTION
As people on all walks of life have a lot of important tasks to do especially in the Information Age but unable to have good time management, the developer has introduced this 
prototype named P.H.O.N.E.S. for whether you are a worker or a student, this prototype can allow people to use its simple design easily and become more productive in their goals.
P.H.O.N.E.S. or People Helped in Orderly Notifications and Eased Schedules is a simple android application created by Elizan of Team EL with the idea of assisting people who are 
unable to properly do any task on time and provide features from other applications. The application’s intended task is to help keep track of people’s day to day accomplishments 
in their daily lives to both motivate and help them stay on pace. The intended users for the application are of the general global population for workers and students alike.

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
The prototype was created with the use of Figma. This is because Figma is an interactive Prototyping Software/Website that can be easily distributed to testers with the use of 
links sent by the developer. I have opted to use Figma as the method of creating this prototype since it is a free interactive program or website that can be accessed by both 
members of the team to edit the prototype. It also lets the developer showcase the final design of the application when launched. Furthermore, Figma is very convenient when it 
comes to presenting and sharing prototypes to users who are not physically present and can easily be edited when feedback has been received. That is not to say that Figma is 
without flaws, Figma will require internet access when saving edits thus keeping the user from exiting the program if they have no internet connection. It will also be a bit of 
a problem when used in a larger screen since small buttons will be difficult to press.

PROTOTYPE INFORMATION
The tasks for this prototype are split into three (3) different sections: Main Menu Tasks, Schedule Tasks, and Tasks pages. Below are some of the tasks that the selected 
participants will be asked to perform for each section to showcase the prototype’s functionality:
-	Enter and Exit the Prototype. (Main Menu Task)
-	How easy will the user be able to navigate while using the Prototype.
-	Participants will be asked in creating schedules and tasks. (Schedules and Tasks)
-	Participants will be asked in deleting schedules or tasks. (Schedules)
-	Participants will be asked to edit schedules. (Schedules and Tasks)
Reasons that these tasks were selected for the participants since the prototype was designed with these measures in mind:
-	Easy Navigation
-	Allow users to do CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
The selected benchmark tasks were necessary to see how well a user can interact with the prototype. It would benefit the developer greatly knowing which areas could be
further improved. The aspects that worked in this prototype were the CRUD system while its hard navigation is a problem and there were also some drawbacks such as the
customization of schedules or tasks as well the inconsistent navigations. The developer also failed to implement online features which would have provided participants more
to do within the prototype but was cut short due to lack of time. If the developer would have more time, the implementations of online features, music features, and many more
would be added to give the prototype a more unique and fresher feel to it.
